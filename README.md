# spatial_aggregations_tutorial
Walk through on all-things spatial aggregations. The main focus is aggregating climate/exposure variables over (raster) grids into (GIS vector) polygons. 

____

This tutorial focuses on:

1. **Frequently asked questions**

* What is the difference between gis vector data and rasters?
* What is the difference between overlay vs rasterize?
* What are multiple rasterization strategies?
* What is the difference between downscaling and upsampling?
* What are computationally efficient options for spatial aggregations?
* How can I perform discrete variable aggregations?

2. **Example scripts and end-to-end pipelines for spatial aggregations**

* Python example script for spatial aggregations using rasterization (`rasterstats` package)
* Python example script for discrete variable aggregations: climate types on the USA
* Blazing fast end-to-end pipelines for spatial aggregations

### Main Applications of Spatial Aggregations in Environmental Health Data Science

1. **Environmental Monitoring and Modeling**:
   * Spatial aggregations enables the integration of satellite imagery with vector data, such as habitat boundaries, to monitor ecosystem changes, deforestation, and wildfire spread[^1][^2].
   * It supports modeling continuous environmental phenomena like air pollution, temperature, and precipitation across landscapes[^1][^3].
2. **Exposure Assessment, Urban Planning and Public Health**
   * Spatial aggregations of climate and pollution data are used to estimate individual or population-level exposure to environmental hazards (e.g., heat waves or air pollutants) by overlaying grids with demographic polygons[^4][^5].
4. **Disaster Preparedness and Response**:
   * Spatial aggregations are crucial for tracking natural disasters like floods or hurricanes and assessing their health impacts by combining raster hazard maps with population density polygons[^6][^2].
5. **Agricultural and Food Security Studies**:
   * Spatial aggregations of soil temperature, crop health, and irrigation data help assess food security risks and optimize agricultural practices to mitigate environmental health impacts like malnutrition[^6].
